# D-FAST Bank Erosion

This is one of the [Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl) Fluvial Assessment Tools to be used in conjunction with D-Flow FM.
The purpose of this particular tool is
* to compute local bank erosion sensitivity, and
* to give an estimate of the amount of bank material that will be eroded
    * during the first year, and
    * until equilibrium.

The user should carry out a number of steady state hydrodynamic simulations for different discharges using [D-Flow FM](https://www.deltares.nl/en/software/module/d-flow-flexible-mesh/).
The results of these simulations will be combined with some basic morphological characteristics to estimate the bank erosion.
