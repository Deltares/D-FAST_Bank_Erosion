# I/O Module

The I/O module is responsible for handling input/output operations in the D-FAST Bank Erosion software. It provides functionality for reading configuration files, loading and saving data, and logging.

## Overview

The I/O module serves as the interface between the D-FAST Bank Erosion software and external data sources and destinations. It handles reading configuration files, loading hydrodynamic simulation results, saving bank lines and erosion results, and logging information during the execution of the software.

## Components

The I/O module consists of the following components:

### Configuration

::: dfastbe.io.config

The configuration component handles reading and parsing configuration files, which specify parameters for bank line detection and erosion calculation.

### Data Models

::: dfastbe.io.data_models

The data models component provides classes for representing various types of data used in the I/O operations.

### File Utilities

::: dfastbe.io.file_utils

The file utilities component provides functions for file operations, such as reading and writing files.

### Logging

::: dfastbe.io.logger

The logging component handles logging information during the execution of the software.

## Workflow

The typical workflow for using the I/O module is:

1. Read a configuration file using the `ConfigFile.read` method
2. Use the configuration to load input data (hydrodynamic simulation results, bank lines, etc.)
3. Process the data using the Bank Lines and Bank Erosion modules
4. Save the results using the I/O module's functions

## Usage Example

```python
from dfastbe.io.config import ConfigFile
from dfastbe.bank_erosion.bank_erosion import Erosion

# Read configuration file
config_file = ConfigFile.read("config.cfg")

# Use configuration to initialize Erosion object
erosion = Erosion(config_file)

# Run erosion calculation (which will use I/O module to load and save data)
erosion.run()
```
