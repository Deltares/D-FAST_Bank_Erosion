\chapter{Introduction}

This document describes the code design considerations for the development of \dfastbe.
\dfastbe is the successor of WAQBANK.
The purpose of these tools is to provide an estimate of the bank erosion due to currents and shipping.
The conceptual WAQBANK framework was developed since 2010.
To obtain the estimate of the bank erosion, the algorithm needs data on e.g.

\begin{itemize}
\item velocity distribution at a number of representative discharges,
\item bank composition and protection, and
\item shipping characteristics.
\end{itemize}

Based on these data the algorithm provides estimates of the average and maximum erosion distances along the studied reach after a characteristic period, and when the ultimate equilibrium conditions have been reached.
The original WAQBANK tool performs the analysis based on results obtained from WAQUA or Delft3D 4 simulations.
The new \dfastbe tool performs the analysis based on D-Flow FM simulation results.
