\chapter{Detecting and shifting the bank lines} \label{Chp:BankDetect}

This chapter describes the algorithms used for detecting (see \autoref{Sec:BankDetect}) and shifting (see \autoref{Sec:BankShift}) the bank lines.
The former happens in the 'banklines' step, whereas the latter happens in the 'bankerosion' step after the local bank erosion rate has been computed.

\section{Detecting the bank lines} \label{Sec:BankDetect}

The location of bank lines is determined by looking at the transition of water to land (wet/dry) at a reference discharge computed using \dflowfm.
The detection of the bank lines builds on the search lines provided as input to this step.
The model domain is clipped to the area close to the search lines to focus the bank detection algorithm on the areas of interest only.
The exact location of the bank lines starts by determining for each grid cell in the area of interest whether it has one (or more) bed levels $z_b$ (defined at the mesh nodes) above the water level $z_w$ in the grid cell and one (or more) bed levels below the water level (see \autoref{Fig3.1}).

\Note \dfastbe currently only supports results of hydrodynamic simulations which use bed levels defined at nodes.
Simulations with bed levels defined in cells (tile depth) are thus not supported.

\end{figure}

For each of those grid cells, the subgrid boundary between dry and wet parts is determined as the line along which the interpolated bed level equals the water level in the grid cell.
The line marking the zero water depth is a straight line in a triangle.
Cells with $N_c \ge 4$ corners are split in $N_c - 2$ triangles to arrive at a collection of only straight line segments.
The collection of all these line segments forms the basis of the final bank line.

The found locations of the bank lines will clearly depend on the chosen discharge level.
However, as long as the discharge is within the main channel, the locations will be fairly consistent.

Generally, bank erosion only occurs along the main channel.
It is therefore possible to only take into account those cells that are within a certain distance from the predefined search lines.
This is also necessary when more than one bank line is present (as is common in rivers), because otherwise it is not clear which coordinates belong to one bank or the other.

The search lines should be defined in a simple text file consisting of x- and y- coordinates (\command{Line1}, ..., \command{LineN}, in the configuration file). For the Dutch rivers the lines can be obained from the Baseline 'oeverlijnen' for model schematisations up to Baseline 4. For modelschematisations of Baseline 5 and higher the oeverlijnen can be obtained by: 1) merging the baseline section 1 and 2 polygon in one polygon feature, 2) transfering this polygon to a polyline feature, 3) cutting this feature into two separate banklines and 4) transforming these lines to points along the lines with an interval of 10 meters.

By using the oeverlijnen, or section 1-2 boundary from Baseline the tool only depicts the main channel. Possible side channels, shortcuts or lakes will not be detected by the tool, see \autoref{Fig3.2}.
If they are important, extra lines should be added that (globally) represent the bank lines of these individual features. For this the input NBank should be increased by the number of extra features and the location of the bank line file \command{LineN} should point to the new file(s) with the xy-coordinates of extra search line(s). It should be noted that for the analysis of these extra bank sections the tool uses the closest point in the mainchannel for which the fairway and riveraxis are specified.

Groynes are not detected as such by the tool, because they are typically defined on subgrid level in the simulations, see \autoref{Fig3.3}.
The detected bank line is in this case following the banks within groyne sections.
This is an advantage, since possible bank erosion only takes place in the groyne sections and not along the groynes themselves.

\section{Common issues with bank line detection} \label{Sec:DetectIssues}
It is advised to check the detected banklines shown in the graphical output of the 'banklines'mode before continuing with the 'bankerosion'mode. This section describes some common issues and their solutions.

\subsection{Detection of adjacent water body}
At some locations an adjacent water body is located within the given search distance from the pre-defined banklines (parameter Dlines). As a result the banklinke of the adjacent water body is found, instead of the bankline of the main river channel. As a result the initial bankline shows strange variations. This is the case between kilometer 20 and 21 in \autoref{Fig_issue_bankline}.

\begin{figure}[!hb]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/detection_issue.png}
	\caption{Detection of the initial bank line close to adjacent water bodies (Q=278,5 m\textsuperscript{3}/s, average discharge)}
	\label{Fig_issue_bankline}
\end{figure}

By decreasing the parameter Dlines you decrease the search distance from the pre-defined lines for determining the bank lines. As a result, you decrease the chance that the bankline of an adjacent water  body is found. However, you won't find a correct initial bankline if you make the parameter Dlines too small, this can be especially the case close to groins, at wide shallow areas or along banks with a relatively flat slope (see left bank between kilometer 22 and 23 in \autoref{Fig_issue_bankline}).

Another option is to edit the initial bankline manually by removing the points that fall in the adjacent water body, so only the points along the main channel remain.

\subsection{Irregularities in the detected bank line}
\autoref{Fig_issue_bankline} shows at the right outer bank after kilometer 22.5 a strange irregularity in the detected initial bank line. This type of irregularities develop either by the detection of adjacent water body's, by the cut of of connections with side channels (see \autoref{Fig_issue_bankline2}) or harbours or other irregularities along the bank. It is advised to edit the initial bankline manually by removing some of the points so a smooth bankline along the main channel remains, because these irregularities influence the distance between the bank and the fairway and thus result in strange irregular patterns in wave heights and erosion along that bank.

\section{Shifting the bank lines} \label{Sec:BankShift}

The new location of the bank line is determined by shifting each bank line segment individually by its local erosion distance.
In the case of a concave bend the eroding segments move apart; a new bank segment is inserted connecting the two end points of the previously connected segments.
In case of a convex bend the eroding segments overlap; in this case the new bank line follows the outline of furthest erosion.
