# D-FAST Bank Erosion

This is one of the [Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl) Fluvial Assessment Tools.
The purpose of this tool is to provide an estimate of the bank erosion that may be expected along a river reach.
The user should carry out a number of steady state hydrodynamic simulations for different discharges using [D-Flow FM](https://www.deltares.nl/en/software/module/d-flow-flexible-mesh/).
The results of these simulations will be combined with some basic morphological characteristics to estimate the bank erosion.
For more details see the documentation section.
